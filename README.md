# App Code 

To use the [analyze_satellite_imagery](app.py)  function, you need to provide a satellite image as input. The function will preprocess the image, detefactors](able terrain features, analyze them, and generate a markdown report with the analysis results.

# Spacecraft Trajectory Prediction 

In this task, we will create a machine learning model that can predict the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft during interplanetary travel. The model will take into account various factors such as gravitational forces, planetary alignments, and fuel consumption. Let's start by importing the [necessary libraries and data](necessary_libraries_and_data.py).

Next, we will [train](train_the_model.py) the machine learning model using linear regression.

Now that our model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data. Let's define a function that takes in the factors (gravity, alignment, and fuel) and returns the [predicted trajectory](predict_trajectory.py).

We can now use this function to predict the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft. Let's say we have the following [values for the factors](values_for_the_factors.py). 

We can call the predict_trajectory function with these values to get the [predicted trajectory](predicted_trajectory.py). 

The output will be the predicted trajectory for the given factors.

Finally, we can generate a markdown report containing the predicted trajectory along with any relevant calculations or simulations performed during the prediction process.

4. Define the PPO algorithm: Implement the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to train the policy network. This algorithm will update the network parameters based on the observed rewards and the policy gradients.

5. Train the model: Use the PPO algorithm to train the reinforcement learning model in the simulated environment. The model will interact with the environment, receive observations, take actions, and learn from the rewards obtained.

6. Evaluate the model: Test the trained model in various scenarios to assess its performance. Measure metrics such as task completion rate, sample collection efficiency, maintenance effectiveness, and construction accuracy.

7. Output the optimized control policies: Generate a markdown document containing the optimized robot control policies learned by the model. This document should provide detailed information on how the robot should act in different situations.
