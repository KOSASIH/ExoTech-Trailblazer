# App Code 

To use the [analyze_satellite_imagery](app.py)  function, you need to provide a satellite image as input. The function will preprocess the image, detefactors](able terrain features, analyze them, and generate a markdown report with the analysis results.

# Spacecraft Trajectory Prediction 

In this task, we will create a machine learning model that can predict the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft during interplanetary travel. The model will take into account various factors such as gravitational forces, planetary alignments, and fuel consumption. Let's start by importing the [necessary libraries and data](necessary_libraries_and_data.py).

Next, we will [train](train_the_model.py) the machine learning model using linear regression.

Now that our model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data. Let's define a function that takes in the factors (gravity, alignment, and fuel) and returns the [predicted trajectory](predict_trajectory.py).

We can now use this function to predict the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft. Let's say we have the following [values for the factors](values_for_the_factors.py) 

We can call the predict_trajectory function with these values to get the [predicted trajectory](
