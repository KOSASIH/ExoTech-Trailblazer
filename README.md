# App Code 

To use the [analyze_satellite_imagery](app.py)  function, you need to provide a satellite image as input. The function will preprocess the image, detefactors](able terrain features, analyze them, and generate a markdown report with the analysis results.

# Spacecraft Trajectory Prediction 

In this task, we will create a machine learning model that can predict the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft during interplanetary travel. The model will take into account various factors such as gravitational forces, planetary alignments, and fuel consumption. Let's start by importing the [necessary libraries and data](necessary_libraries_and_data.py).

Next, we will [train](train_the_model.py) the machine learning model using linear regression.

Now that our model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data. Let's define a function that takes in the factors (gravity, alignment, and fuel) and returns the [predicted trajectory](predict_trajectory.py).

We can now use this function to predict the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft. Let's say we have the following [values for the factors](values_for_the_factors.py). 

We can call the predict_trajectory function with these values to get the [predicted trajectory](predicted_trajectory.py). 

The output will be the predicted trajectory for the given factors.

Finally, we can generate a markdown report containing the predicted trajectory along with any relevant calculations or simulations performed during the prediction process.

# Trajectory Prediction Report

## Factors 

- Gravity: 9.8 m/s^2
- Alignment: 0.5
- Fuel: 1000 units

## Prediction

The predicted trajectory for the given factors is 250,000 km.

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual calculations and simulations involved in predicting spacecraft trajectories are much more complex. This code serves as a starting point and can be further enhanced and customized based on specific requirements and constraints.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP) System for Space Exploration and Colonization 

## Setup 

To use the NLP system, you need to install the required libraries and models. Run the following [commands to set up the environment](NLP_system.py). 

## Importing Libraries

Import the [necessary libraries](libraries.py) for NLP processing. 

## Preprocessing Text

Before processing the text, we need to perform some preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. The following code snippet demonstrates how to [preprocess the input text](preprocess_text.py) 


## NLP Pipeline

To process the queries and generate responses, we will use the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides pre-trained models for various NLP tasks. Specifically, we will use the question-answering pipeline to extract answers from the input text. 
Here's an example of [how to use the pipeline](nlp_pipeline.py).
