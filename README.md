# App Code 

To use the [analyze_satellite_imagery](app.py)  function, you need to provide a satellite image as input. The function will preprocess the image, detect suitable terrain features, analyze them, and generate a markdown report with the analysis results.

# Spacecraft Trajectory Prediction 

In this task, we will create a machine learning model that can predict the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft during interplanetary travel. The model will take into account various factors such as gravitational forces, planetary alignments, and fuel consumption. Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and data.
